Amos is a lieutenant in the King's Army, made to command a misfit training camp after a rageful outburst at a commanding officer.  He is missing his left pinky and ring finger, but is tight-lipped as to why.  (PARTY can learn on a Persuasion DC 20 that they were cut off after he made a rude gesture to a nobleman as a rambunctious teenager.  He cannot be Intimidated to divulge this information.)  Amos wants nothing more than to excel at his command in the hope that he will be reinstated into the Army proper and rise through the ranks.
